          <h1> Days follows the struggles of Tsukushi Tsukamoto, a shy, clumsy
            and bullied teenager about to start high school. He decides to get
            into Seiseki High School so he can be with his neighbor and childhood
            friend Sayuri Tachibana, who is one year his senior. Just as he is
            bullied after visiting Sayuri at her work, Tsukushi is saved by Jin
            Kazama, who scares away the bullies by attacking them with nunchucks
            , and declares himself to be a vagrant and lost in town. Jin then
            asks Tsukushi if he likes soccer and asks him to join him the same
            night for a futsal match as his team is one player short. Tsukushi
            surprises Jin by showing up after running almost ten miles under the
            heavy rain and without one shoe, after another run-in with his
            bullies. Short, young and clumsy, Tsukushi plays incredibly bad
            but keeps running throughout the whole match despite having injured
            his foot, showing such an effort that it motivates his other
            teammates. After a final sprint, Tsukushi manages to score the
            decisive goal, smashing his head against the pole by doing it. He
            finds out later that Jin will also be a freshman at Seiseki, and
            decides to join the soccer club to play with him, unknowing that
            the soccer club in Seiseki is nationwide famous and looked after
            by students from all the country. He manages to make it to the
            team despite being incredibly frail, weak and clumsy thanks to his
            continuous efforts and amazing perseverance, and further he shows
            incredible ability in motivating the rest of the team to work as
            hard as possible.
